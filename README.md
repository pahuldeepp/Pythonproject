The Jarvis is a virtual assistant that combines the power of speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and advanced AI language processing. Using Python libraries like pyautogui, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, and openai, Jarvis can perform a variety of tasks, from clicking and dragging on the screen to answering complex queries by leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. Jarvis listens for a wake word ("Jarvis") and can execute commands such as opening websites, playing music, fetching the latest news, and even generating responses to user queries using AI. This integration creates a versatile assistant capable of both mundane tasks and engaging conversations, simulating the behavior of advanced AI assistants like Alexa or Siri.
